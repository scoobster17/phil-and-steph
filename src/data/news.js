We are soaring off to our chosen destination of Jamaica soon after the wedding for the lovely honeymoon trip of a lifetime!</p><p>We don't want to give too much away in advance, but we are jetting off after spending some time in a lovely airport lounge. After a quick stop off in Miami (unfortunately not leaving the airport) we then jump to Jamaica and find ourselves in another lounge.</p><p>We are then whisked away into an all-inclusive luxurious stay in a beautiful room with a private butler (which we both still feel a bit awkward about!) and a semi-private pool.</p><img src=\"/img/wedding/honeymoon/full-site.jpg\" alt=\"Full honeymoon resort in Jamaica, large hotel in a sunny paradise with clear blue water\" /><img src=\"/img/wedding/honeymoon/beach.jpg\" alt=\"Private beach to the resort, looking across white sands out to sea\" /><p>We have many activities at hand to keep us busy, with a wide range of watersports available and excursions too to explore the island a bit further. It won't just be a trip laying out sunbathing all day every day! We both couldn't stand that much time together with nothing to do! Haha!</p><img src=\"/img/wedding/honeymoon/snuba.jpg\" alt=\"a couple doing snuba\" /><p>Of course, we are both the type of people who would rather go and experience the culture somewhat, rather than go and stay in an 'English resort' with an 'English experience'. We very much look forward to delving into the Caribbean food in particular!</p><img src=\"/img/wedding/honeymoon/dolphin.jpg\" alt=\"a woman kissing a dolphin on the lips\" /></section>",

		"content": "<section class=\"panel\"><p>Welcome to the renewed and slightly refreshed version of the PhilAndSteph.co.uk website! Although it may not look all that different, it has been re-built from the ground up!</p><p>The first thing you will likely notice is the countdown on the home page. This is of course for Steph as it is for everyone else to keep track. She's excited for some reason, now it's 2017...</p><p>The idea with the re-design is to not only use new technologies to make me look better, but also to make improvements including performance. One thing you may notice is that pages load <strong>instantaneously</strong>. This is because of something called React which is a new and fancy bit of technology. It does mean you need JavaScript to be enabled, unless you set the site up differently, which I have. You will find that you can go to a different page, refresh (as you would expect to be able to) and you will still see your desired content. For techy people, this is because the app is universally rendered. Two things to add to my CV, which of course, now, this site is going to be featured in more prominently!</p><p>Other updates to the site include a new 'events' page, properly listing events to do with the wedding and the lead up to it, a 'news' page with articles to keep you up-to-date on the latest happenings with the wedding planning, preparation and just random information like this article, and a new 'people' page so you can get to know the bridal party a little bit before the big day.</p><p>This site will be much more frequently updated in the lead up to the wedding now, so make sure you come back more often!</p></section>",

Steph did have to think about the questions a little bit sometimes, but I'll let her off. She does cook me dinner... In fact the meeting wasn't that bad, and the questions were quite basic. We didn't have to \"prove we loved each other\" as expected. It was quite quick too!</p><p>After the meeting, of course we had to celebrate, so we chose to do this in style and go to Nandos!</p><p>So that's it now, we are officially allowed to get married! How exciting!</p></section><img src=\"/img/wedding/misc/registrar.jpg\" alt=\"Man in suits signing some papers at a desk\" />",
