			"content": "<section class=\"panel\"><h2>Where it all began</h2><p><img class=\"in-paragraph img-left\" src=\"/img/wedding/characters/beast.png\" alt=\"The Beast from Disney's Beauty and the Beast\" />It all really began on the first of January 2015. We were out for New Years Eve, and as fireworks lit up the skies of London on the television, after the New Years kisses and celebrations had died down, there was time to think about the year ahead. It may have been the bright ginger glow that caught my attention, but in any case Stephanie was on my mind.</p><p>We had been together a couple of years now; where was it going? We had spoken about marriage in hypothetical terms, and subtle (but not so subtle) hints had been dropped (and were to increase in quantity!), but as I thought about it, there was a feeling inside me. This is the year.</p></section><section class=\"panel\"><h2>The build up</h2><p><img class=\"in-paragraph img-right\" src=\"/img/wedding/characters/belle.png\" alt=\"Belle from Disney's Beauty and the Beast\" />The following months contained a lot of decision making and idea generation, including stealthy research… asking questions about which Disney Princess was Steph's favourite for instance (no it's not Belle!).</p><p>The summer holidays came and passed; my initial intended time for doing the deed. I had ideas of how and where, just not the when. This was made a lot easier when a trip to Las Vegas in the September with the lads popped up. Getting added onto the holiday at the last minute, a plan formed; I was spending pretty much all of my savings on this “trip of a lifetime”, and Steph knew that. But what if I could work it so I had enough left afterwards to buy a ring? What a surprise that would be!</p></section><section class=\"panel\"><h2>Preparation</h2><p>Saturday, 10th October 2015 was the day, there were enough funds after the Vegas trip. All systems go.</p><p>It was decided a bit last minute with the exact date being up in the air due to Steph's mum being unwell and her going round constantly to help out / visit.</p><p>Steph headed out early in the morning for that reason. Still in bed when she left (and wanting to give her the impression I was staying there), I got up as soon as she pulled away and was on my feet for the rest of the day.</p><p>Firstly a trip to Tesco to obtain the final props, followed by going to my parent's house to paint said props and more.</p><p>Rushing around worrying not knowing exactly when Steph would be back, Dad came back to the house with me to set up the more difficult decorations. After he left, final decorating was sorted and dinner was started. So now we get to the bit we really all want to know about. What Steph experienced.</p></section><section class=\"panel\"><h2>The proposal experience</h2><p>Steph arrived home to find me in the kitchen in a t-shirt and shorts cooking an unknown dish. Bags in hand, she put them down and asked what was for dinner. Confirming that she really wanted to know I revealed it was her favourite; Spaghetti Bolognese, with the important addition of a garlic bread side.</p><p>The meal was at a point where it could be left alone, so I said to her that I have one thing I need her to do. After she offers to help with the dinner, and me kindly declining, I tell her to enter our living room, which currently has the door to.</p><p><img class=\"in-paragraph img-left\" src=\"/img/wedding/events/proposal/note.jpg\" alt=\"The note instructing Steph to go upstairs as a surprise awaits her. It also informs her the conservatory is off limits. The note looks like is has been printed on parchment, and has a large no entry sign.\" />As she enters the room she sees our conservatory windows are blocked out with paper littering the panes of glass, nets pulled across on the curtain rail and a faint but discernable no entry logo on what seems to be a piece of parchment (actually a tea-stained A4 printed note).</p><p>The note reveals there is a gift waiting upstairs. As we part ways as I return to the kitchen and she goes upstairs alone, I order her to not come down until told otherwise. She goes upstairs to find a princess Belle dress and shoes. Whilst she prepares herself, I quickly change into the smart clothes I have hidden in the kitchen. After finishing cooking / dishing up dinner I unlock the conservatory (no, I didn't trust her not to peek!), light the candles and bring out dinner and drinks, I go up to retrieve her.</p><p>After leading her downstairs and to the once again closed conservatory doors, I hint for her to open the doors herself as I prepare to play the recently downloaded Beauty and the Beast Soundtrack just as she gets her first glance of the whole dinner experience.</p><p>As the recognizable chorus plays, she is met by our conservatory completely fitted out with nets blocking out most if not all natural light. The thick rippled nets give an air of 'fancy-do' about them, whilst they bow down from the ceiling rising up to the middle in a circus tent fashion.</p><p>The light then that is visible emanates from the two subtle lamps that we have, and three lit candles upon a golden candlestick holder. But these are no ordinary candles, and this is no ordinary candlestick holder. No; it has a painted face to look like Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast. He is joined by Chip the cup and Mrs Potts the teapot, recently bought from Tesco and painted that day. Cogsworth sits quietly at the back of the table, and other assorted Disney characters litter the half of the table we are not eating up to, including Ariel in a make-do water tank. Books also are present to signify Belle's love for reading, but not just any books; antique looking hardback books.</p><p>We sit down at the table to eat, and Steph ignores it and immediately goes to touch everything. I quickly tell her off and we proceed with dinner.</p><p>After we ate, and of course the chef received his compliments on the meal, Steph was then allowed to freely roam amongst the props.</p><p><img class=\"in-paragraph img-right\" src=\"/img/wedding/events/proposal/rose.jpg\" alt=\"The rose from the proposal, enclosed in a small bell jar\" />At first she picks up a couple of the characters and inspects them, followed by childishly (but cutely) pouring a cup of air-tea, she then focuses on the more central table piece. Along with the characters, there is the pivotal pink rose inside a bell jar. This is when Steph's attention comes to the rose. Up the glassware goes and out comes the rose.</p><p>After a quick inspection - after all it's just a flower - Steph goes to put this back down on the table. I instruct her to take a closer look. That was when she noticed the glisten amongst the petals.</p><p>She struggled to take off the gloves that came as part of her costume, and as she did she found a rogue petal from another pink rose covering up a sparkling diamond ring.</p><p>As she took a breath, I took the ring from her, got down on one knee to the side of the table and asked her to marry me.</p><p>After a tear left each eye and rolled down her cheeks, she smiled and said one word.</p><p><strong>Yes</strong>.</p></section><section><div class=\"match-width\"><img class=\"in-paragraph img-left\" src=\"/img/wedding/events/proposal/proposal.jpg\" alt=\"The rose from the proposal, enclosed in a small bell jar\" /><img class=\"in-paragraph img-right\" src=\"/img/wedding/events/proposal/beauty-and-the-beast.jpg\" alt=\"The rose from the proposal, enclosed in a small bell jar\" /></div></section>"
