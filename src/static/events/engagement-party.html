	<h2>Where was it?</h2>
	<p>
		We hired the Laindon Community Centre for the evening of Saturday 14<sup>th</sup> November 2015, with guests to arrive from 7pm. Once inside the venue by either of the main entrances, opposite reception are 3 doors amongst toilet doors, the far left one gains entrance to the hall that was hired.

	<p>The venue is close enough to our home that we could stumble home afterwards!</p>
