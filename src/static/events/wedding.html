	<h2>Wedding Day Details</h2>
	<p>
		The big event upcoming in July 2017 is set. Oh no, you&apos;ve got to start worrying about what to wear. What everyone else will be wearing. What they serve at the bar. Oh dear. Here you can find out all you need to know for the wedding day...
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course we aren't going to tell you every detail, as we want at least some of it to be a surprise! But I'm sure by now (especially if you have heard the proposal story either first hand or here) that you will realise there is a Beauty and the Beast theme, albeit a subtle one.

	<h2>What's Happening</h2>
	<p>
		People are gathering to celebrate the marriage of Phil and Steph as they commit themselves to one another for life. What on earth are they thinking!
	</p>
	<p>
		The day will consist of a marriage ceremony, followed by a time for photographs, ending up in a party to celebrate, with a DJ, lots of lovely food, and a couple of surprises along the way!

	<h2>Where to go</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.threeriversclub.com/" class="textLink" rel="external">Three Rivers Golf and Country Club</a>; a beautiful and glorious green blanket of grass lays background to a fairly modern country club building.
	</p>
	<p>
		The venue is located out in the sticks in the beautiful green landscape of Essex. If you are coming from the West (which most of you are we believe) you are sure to revel in some sheep-sighting en route and hopefully arrive under a glistening warm sun! Fingers crossed!
	</p>
	<p>
		A map will be here soon! And a way to get directions, for planning in advance or even on the day!

	<h2>Where to stay</h2>
	<p>
		There are rooms at the venue, however these have been pre-booked by the bride and groom and pre-allocated to immediate family and the bridal party etc. Therefore it is advised that if you wish to stay over near the venue you should book a room nearby.
