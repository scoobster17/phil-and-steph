	<h2>Who's Invited</h2>
	<p>
		Invitations are yet to be sent out. Only guests who receive an invitation are permitted to attend the wedding ceremony and/or reception.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that we would like a nice, much smaller, more intimate gathering for our wedding, and to this end we are not inviting everyone that was invited to the engagement party.
	</p>
	<p>
		The idea with the engagement party was to have an event where we could celebrate with everyone our proposed marriage.

	<h2>Where to go</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.threeriversclub.com/" class="textLink" rel="external">Three Rivers Golf and Country Club</a>; a beautiful and glorious green blanket of grass lays background to a fairly modern country club building.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are rooms at the venue, however these have been pre-booked by the bride and groom and pre-allocated to immediate family and the bridal party etc. Therefore it is advised that if you wish to stay over near the venue you should book a room nearby.
