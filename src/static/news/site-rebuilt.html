		Welcome to the renewed and slightly refreshed version of the PhilAndSteph.co.uk website! Although it may not look all that different, it has been re-built from the ground up!
	</p>
	<p>
		The first thing you will likely notice is the countdown on the home page. This is of course for Steph as it is for everyone else to keep track. She's excited for some reason, now it's 2017...

		The idea with the re-design is to not only use new technologies to make me look better, but also to make improvements including performance. One thing you may notice is that pages load <strong>instantaneously</strong>. This is because of something called React which is a new and fancy bit of technology. It does mean you need JavaScript to be enabled, unless you set the site up differently, which I have. You will find that you can go to a different page, refresh (as you would expect to be able to) and you will still see your desired content. For techy people, this is because the app is universally rendered. Two things to add to my CV, which of course, now, this site is going to be featured in more prominently!
	</p>
	<p>
		Other updates to the site include a new 'events' page, properly listing events to do with the wedding and the lead up to it, a 'news' page with articles to keep you up-to-date on the latest happenings with the wedding planning, preparation and just random information like this article, and a new 'people' page so you can get to know the bridal party a little bit before the big day.
	</p>
	<p>
		This site will be much more frequently updated in the lead up to the wedding now, so make sure you come back more often!
