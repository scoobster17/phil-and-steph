		The registrar has been booked and fully paid for, so the wedding is now officially going ahead!
	</p>
	<p>
		We undertook a highly tense meeting with Essex Registrars, where we were individually questioned about the other. Steph did have to think about the questions a little bit sometimes, but I'll let her off. She does cook me dinner... In fact the meeting wasn't that bad, and the questions were quite basic. We didn't have to "prove we loved each other" as expected. It was quite quick too!
	</p>
	<p>
		After the meeting, of course we had to celebrate, so we chose to do this in style and go to Nandos!
	</p>
	<p>
		So that's it now, we are officially allowed to get married! How exciting!
