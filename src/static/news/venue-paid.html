		That's it, it's definitely happening. Venue? Paid. Registrar? Paid. Sorted! We are all set now to get married so make sure you book that time off! And perhaps the Tuesday too if you plan on it being a heavy one!
	</p>
	<p>
		We look forward to seeing you, our guests, on our special day, and sharing in our commitment to one another. (Don't tell Steph but I'm more excited about the honeymoon!)
