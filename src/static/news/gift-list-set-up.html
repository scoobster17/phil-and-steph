		As we have been moved into our lovely home now for over 2 years, we have acquired all that we need (as I'm sure most of you will know having visited), in terms of pot and pans, furniture and everything to make a house a home. We do not expect anything, but if you would like to contribute to our special celebration of marriage, then we have set up the website above so that people can contribute towards components of our honeymoon.
