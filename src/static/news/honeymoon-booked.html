		The honeymoon has now been booked! We are soaring off to our chosen destination of Jamaica soon after the wedding for the lovely honeymoon trip of a lifetime!
	</p>
	<p>
		We don't want to give too much away in advance, but we are jetting off after spending some time in a lovely airport lounge. After a quick stop off in Miami (unfortunately not leaving the airport) we then jump to Jamaica and find ourselves in another lounge.

		We are then whisked away into an all-inclusive luxurious stay in a beautiful room with a private butler (which we both still feel a bit awkward about!) and a semi-private pool.
	</p>

		We have many activities at hand to keep us busy, with a wide range of watersports available and excursions too to explore the island a bit further. It won't just be a trip laying out sunbathing all day every day! We both couldn't stand that much time together with nothing to do! Haha!

		Of course, we are both the type of people who would rather go and experience the culture somewhat, rather than go and stay in an 'English resort' with an 'English experience'. We very much look forward to delving into the Caribbean food in particular!
