		It's deadline day people! If you haven't done so already, please let us know if you are coming to the wedding or not. Many thanks to those that have, by way of wedding acceptance card, returning our RSVP cards, emailing, or even whatsapping pictures of the filled out RSVP cards! Haha. We appreciate everyone that has chosen to be with us on our special day.

		It just so happens that today is the day that Beauty and the Beast comes out at the Cinema too, which we are off to see in the not too distant future! Fancy that! Well done Disney, great timing!
