		The music for the ceremony and wedding breakfast period has been booked! Along with a couple of other final "big" things. We won't tell you what it is just yet (although I think Steph has already blabbed to a few people!), but we hope it will add something really special to the day. And some of the songs we have heard in demonstration have been simply beautiful.

		Hopefully you will recognise some of the instrumentals! If so, we hope you will sing along! If you can get a word in over Steph singing her heart out!
