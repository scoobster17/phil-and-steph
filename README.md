# PhilAndSteph.co.uk Source Code

I have decided to re-write this site from PHP into a React app.

Upon speaking to my friend @shedali he has inspired me to expose more
if not all of what I do, and therefore code I write.

So here it is, the new and improved version of my wedding website,
PhilAndSteph.co.uk.

The Universal aspect of the site was inspired mainly by the following source. I
decided to remove Redux from the site due to time constraints of getting the re-
design turned around, and a lack of tutorials on how to accommodate the setup I
wanted. I eventually reluctantly switched from [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
to [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) also.
